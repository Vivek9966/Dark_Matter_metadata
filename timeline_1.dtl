command: (cutting in, static in the background)\: "Patrol 9, your systems are running hot. We’re seeing some interference—are you reading us clearly?
Jack: Barely. Static’s bad, but you’re coming through.
Well, what’s a mission without everything breaking down at least once?
Kira: For now...
command: Make sure the equipment holds. You’ve got a priority assignment. ISS IsaMora. Last known position north of your current location. No response from the station, minimal power readings detected. Proceed with caution.
Jack: Of course… another 'urgent' repair job on a floating piece of junk. What else is new?
Kira: I don’t get paid enough for this crap. Every time we patch something up, they find another mess for us.
command: Stay focused, pilots. IsaMora’s systems were top of the line. There’s no logical reason for it to be offline.
Kira: Top of the line, huh? Yeah, well, maybe in someone’s imagination. I’ve seen scrap heaps better put together.
Jack: Bet it’s the same idiots who signed off on that ‘upgrade’ that almost blew us up last time.
command: Enough. Get it done. HQ out
Jack: Great. We’re really on our own if these comms die. Just perfect.
