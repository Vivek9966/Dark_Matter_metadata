Jack: Oh my god… what the hell happened here?
Kira: No… no, no, this can’t be real…
Jack: HQ! HQ, do you copy?! HQ, respond!
Kira: Jax, they’re not answering. The comms are dead!
Jack: Oh, you've got to be kidding me! Bandits! We're sitting ducks!
Jack: Shit, shit, shit! Where the hell did they come from?!
Kira: I don’t know, I don’t care! Just keep shooting!
Kira: I’m not dying out here! I swear to God, I am not dying in this piece of crap!
Jack: Just focus! Don’t think, just shoot!
